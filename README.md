# Solving Simultaneous Equations

This source code, *written in C++*, solves two simultaneous equations with two unknows. Its written in C++ using the 
[CodeBlock](http://www.codeblocks.org/) editor.

The simultaanoeus equations are solved using **Elimination method** *to solve them*.

The format of the equations solved are as follows:

```
ax + by = c
dx + ey = f

```
where:
- a,b,c,d,e and f are numbers.
- x and y are the unknowns we are solving for.
